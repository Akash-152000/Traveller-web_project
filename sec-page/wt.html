            <h1>Maroon Bells, USA</h1>
            <p>Located only about 10 miles from Aspen, Colorado, the Maroon Bells are two 14,000-foot peaks in the Elk Mountains that are reflected in crystal-clear Maroon Lake, snuggled in a glacial valley. They are the crown jewels of the Rocky Mountains and by far one of the most photographed scenes in the country.</br>

                It is difficult to say when the timeless beauty of these two sentinels mirrored in the lake is more striking: In the summer, when every hiking trail takes you through fields of wild flowers, in the fall, when tall aspen trees dazzle with a rainbow of fall colors, or in the winter, when snow and ice silence the world.</br> The best photo opportunities are from one of the many hiking trails – access by motor vehicles is limited.</br> The lake is popular among fly-fishermen – even if they don’t catch anything, the beauty all around them is enough.</br></p>

            <h1>Grand Canyon, USA</h1>
            <p>The Grand Canyon is a steep, 1-mile-deep, and up to 18-mile-wide gash in the fabric of the world, an immense gorge carved by the Colorado River over the last 5,000 years.<br/> Its sheer size is breathtaking and although you can see only a small portion of it even from the best vantage point, its geology and its age fire the imagination.<br/>
                 The layers of colorful rock show the passage of time and some of the rocks at the bottom are 1,8 billion years old.<br/></p>

                <h1>Oia, Santorini, Greece</h1>
                <p>Located on top of a cliff with a spectacular view of the Palea volcano, Nea Kameni, and the island of Thirassia, Oia is the most popular and arguably the most beautiful of all the picturesque villages of the Greek island of Santorini.<br/> Only about 11 km from Fira, on the north of the island, Oia will charm you with its traditional stone houses lining the narrow streets, breathtaking blue-domed churches, and sunbaked verandas.<br/>
